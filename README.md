# frontend-blockchain
Blockchain explorer frontend based off of blockscout, whose original source code is located [here](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout)

In order to make edits to Brightvine's block explorer, please consult the notion documents which demonstrate:
- [How to actually run Block Scout, view Block Scout's running status, and the images/configurations which it is pulling from](https://www.notion.so/brightvine/Blockscout-Controls-836c0a19f71340db898ee8a31313634e)
- [How to update Block Scout via dockerhub](https://www.notion.so/brightvine/Blockscout-Dockerhub-aea03bb244564e0196dd88836907cb2c)
- [The location of our customized dockerhub repo](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brightvine/blockscout)
- [Exact information on where theme components are located to be changed](https://www.notion.so/brightvine/Blockscout-Themes-8ac72676b98f42149f9325f9ac34b429)

Despite the upcoming transition to Avalanche, we can likely use the custom block explorer still, if we want that functionality. It may work just to directly substitute in the helm charts in besu-kubernetes.
